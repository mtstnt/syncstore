# SyncStore
A project to help me synchronize my local images/files in my tablet, phone, and desktop to have the same version and no duplicates.  

Consists of:
- Backend (this)
- React Native/Flutter app (coming soon)
- React web app (coming soon)

Authentication:
- Might try to implement simple token based auth, stored in memory or in Redis.
